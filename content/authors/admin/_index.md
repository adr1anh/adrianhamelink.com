Hi, I'm Adrian!

I'm currently finishing my Master's degree in computer science at EPFL, with a strong focus on cryptography.

I am currently working on my Master's project with [Aztec Network](https://aztec.network). The goal is to find new techniques to improve efficiency of the Plonk proof system.

Previously, I worked part-time alongside my studies, for [Taurus](https://www.taurushq.com/) as a research intern, with a strong focus on threshold signature schemes.

Hi, I'm Adrian.

I'm a cryptography engineer with experience in zero-knowledge proof systems, threshold signature schemes, and secure multi-party computation. 
At the moment, I'm working for [Aztec](https://aztec.network) on PlonK-ish proof systems,
where I fight with polynomials to improve zkSNARK performance. 
I graduated from EPFL in 2022 where I obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in computer science. 
Previously, I worked part-time alongside my studies, for [Taurus](https://www.taurushq.com/) as a research intern, with a strong focus on threshold signature schemes.

I am currently working on my Master's project with [Aztec Network](https://aztec.network). The goal is to find new techniques to improve efficiency of the Plonk proof system.

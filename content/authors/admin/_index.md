Hi, I'm Adrian!

I'm currently finishing my Master's degree in computer science at EPFL, with a strong focus on cryptography.

Alongside my studies, I'm working part-time for [Taurus](https://www.taurushq.com/) as a reasearch intern, under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Aumasson.
I'm currently researching new ways of integrating modern cryptographic tools in the context of cryptocurrency custody.
